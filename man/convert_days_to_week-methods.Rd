\description{
This is an internal function of the package vetsyn, made available as an 
exported funciton in order to allow users to take advantage of the 
function retro_summary() from the package. That function
generates a markdown file with R code that can be useful for users
during restrospective analysis of syndromic data. When those R codes are run
manually by the user, this function may be needed.
