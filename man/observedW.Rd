\description{
This dataset exemplifies the case when a user of the package 
{vetsyn} may already have data cleaned and organized in a matrix format,
with the columns representing counts for each syndromic group monitored,
and the rows representing the time units (here WEEKS).
This could be the case when users prefer not to convert raw data to a matrix
format using the functionalities of the package, but instead their
own customized functions and adjustments. The matrix could then be readly
transformed into a syndromic object using the function \code{syndromicW()}.
For daily data please use \code{syndromic()}.
