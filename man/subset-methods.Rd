\description{
Allows sub-setting of syndromic objects (\code{syndromicD} or 
\code{syndromicW}) with all of its slots, by a start and end number of rows.
}
\examples{
data(lab.daily)
my.syndromicD <- raw_to_syndromicD (id=lab.daily$SubmissionID,
                                  syndromes.var=lab.daily$Syndrome,
                                  dates.var=lab.daily$DateofSubmission,
                                  date.format="\%d/\%m/\%Y")
## create a subset that ony includes the first 10 time points
## (all the slots are trimmed from rows 1 to 10)
## note the use of "," instead of ":"
subset <- my.syndromicD[1,10]
