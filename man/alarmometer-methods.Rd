\usage{
alarmometer(score, scale = 9, radius = 4, center = 5.5,
  fill.colors = c("yellow2", "orange", "tomato"), arrow.colors = c("green",
  "orange", "tomato", "red"))
}
\arguments{
\item{score}{the observed alarm score for which an alarm meter is desired.}

\item{scale}{the maximum possible score (scale of alarms). Based on the number
of detection algorithms used, and the number of detection limits set to each
(3 algorithms with 5 detection limits for each, for instance, will give a
scale of 15)}

\item{radius}{the radius of the circle to be drawn. It's generally not necessary 
to set this parameter, since the resulting figure doesn't show the scale.}

\item{center}{the center of plotting, but the scale is not shown, so generally
should not need to be changed.}

\item{fill.colors}{the colors to be used for the 3 degrees of alarm. By default
they are yellow, orange and light red (tomato).}

\item{arrow.colors}{the colors of the arrow for varying levels of alarm. By
default green is used when the score is zero, and a progressive scale
is used for increasing scores: orange, tomato and red.}
