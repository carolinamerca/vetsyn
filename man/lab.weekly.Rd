\description{
This dataset was extracted from a database of laboratory test
submissions. The actual dates have been altered and the animal species 
is not given, in order to 
comply with the privacy policies. Further, all test information
has been removed and only the final syndromic classification is given. Only
the minimal nuber of columns needed to demonstrate the functionalities of the package
have been kept. These are: a column with the syndromic classification, a column 
specifying the date of submission, and one or multiple columns used to 
identify unique cases. In this particular dataset a case is defined as a unique 
combination of date, herdID and submissionID. HerdID and SubmissionID in this 
dataset have been altered to ensure privacy.
